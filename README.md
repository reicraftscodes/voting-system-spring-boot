# 🗳️ Basic UK Voting System

## Description
This project is part of an ongoing learning process.
A simple implementation of a UK-style voting system built for practice and experimental purposes. This project simulates the core functionalities of a general election process in the United Kingdom — including voter registration, candidate listing, vote casting, and result tallying.

Designed to illustrate how a first-past-the-post voting system works, this project serves as a foundation for learning about election systems, data handling, and basic application logic.

## Features
- Register voter with their National Insurance Number
- Vote for a preferred party list
- Verify if a user has already voted to prevent duplicate votes
- Count votes and display election results

## 🔧 Ongoing development
- Test: Add unit tests using JUnit and Mockito
- Future updates: More features, improved validation, and better result reporting

## 📘 API Documentation

Swagger UI is available once the application is running at:
👉 http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html

## Disclaimer
This project is for educational and experimental use only.
It is not intended for real-world election or production use.
